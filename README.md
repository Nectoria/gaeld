Gäld (Swiss German for Money) is an open-source accounting software designed for **Swiss small and medium enterprises (PME)**.
Built with Laravel, Gäld aims to bring **digital independence**, **local compliance**, and **open innovation** to the Swiss business ecosystem.

> **Free. Swiss. Independent. Open.**

## 🎯 Mission

- Provide a **complete accounting** solution built for Swiss business reality.
- Ensure **data sovereignty** by allowing full self-hosting or Swiss-hosted options.
- Guarantee **compliance** with Swiss legal and fiscal standards.
- Build a **community-driven platform** where accountants, developers, and entrepreneurs collaborate openly.
